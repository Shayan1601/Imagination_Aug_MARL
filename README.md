# Imagination_Aug_MARL
In this project we want to extend the Imagination augmented model-based reinforcement learning to multi-agent scenarios and see how it improves
the training process in terms of performance, robustness and sample efficinecy.
We are building on the works done by researchers from DeepMind. The original paper, titled "Imagination-Augmented Agents for Deep Reinforcement Learning," can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06203.
