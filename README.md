# Imagination_Aug_MARL
In this project we want to extend the Imagination augmented model-based reinforcement learning to multi-agent scenarios and see how it improves
    the training process in terms of performance, robustness and sample efficinecy.
    We are building on the works done by researchers from DeepMind. The original paper, titled "Imagination-Augmented Agents for Deep Reinforcement Learning," can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06203.
The multi agent environment that we chose to implement this method on is called "Find the Treasure". The environment consists of two rooms , two agents (agent 1 and agent2) that will run in one room and the treasure is in the other room . The two agents will be denoted using color red and blue , and the treasure will be marked with green. Blocks in black are obstacles that agents could not step on and white ones are free spaces. the agents and the treasure are in separated rooms. There is a secret door on one of the walls. In the larger room, there will be a lever, marked by yellow . If any of the agent is standing on the lever position, the secret door will open and the other agent gets the access to the smaller room to get treasure. If any agent stands on the treasure position, the system resets , which means the two agents are relocated in the bottom room.
